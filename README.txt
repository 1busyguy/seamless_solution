VIDEO STITCHER

The app allows you take videos that you have taken frames from to create new videos to extend a fluid video, BUT you only have the raw videos that are not trimmed... This solves that.
Create your videos, and save them local in the order that you want them to flow.
Then upload the video to the app and it will find the input image within the video and trim them perfectly.


Instructions:

1. Unzip everything into a folder.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.11.x installed.
   Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
3. Double-click "run.bat" (Windows). The app will set up a virtual environment and open in your browser.
4. Upload videos, arrange them, and stitch together!
5. Download the final video or find it in the "app/output" folder.

If you have issues, install Python 3.11.x and try again.
